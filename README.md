# DeathsDoorSaveManager
Unofficial Save Manager for the video game Death's Door

# Description

The DeathsDoorSaveManager tool is used to import and export saves for Death's Door. You can
use it to create snapshots of your run at various stages, and reload those
snapshots at any time.

The main use-case for this program is to practice boss fights, encounters, or glitches.

# Installation

The DeathsDoorSaveManager is a portable executable, which means it does not require
direct installation on your PC. However, it does require the .NET Framework.
When you first try to run the SaveManager, your PC wil prompt you to install
.NET, if necessary.

# Usage

The Save Manger is a single window, with inputs for:
 - Profile: The profile number that you are using for your save in Death's Door

 - Save Folder: The location of your save folder on your PC. By default,
this is `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\LocalLow\Acid Nerve\DeathsDoor\SAVEDATA`

 - Route Folder: The location you want to save your snapshots

Once you fill in the above information, you can type a snapshot name, and click
Create. This will create a file with the .ddsm extension in the folder you
provided.

To load a snapshot, use the dropdown to select the snapshot and then click
Load.
